For implementing machine learning models in pytorch/kera

## Important Note

### Please open only resnet_keras file which contains the trained model upto 5 epochs,due to lack of time i was not able to train it further.Will train it upto 20 epochs as soon as possible as it takes 2 hours for a single epoch.
